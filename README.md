Project title: SOUP or SALAD
<br>
contributers: Moral, Victoria, Crystal

Project Description:
<br>
Soup or Salad is a fun suggestion web-based app providing a list of soup or salad recipes depending on weather conditions in the user's location. The user will be able to enter their location (which will be saved in the client-side and can be changed at any time), as well as an optional dietary profile, and 1-2 ingredients they currently have or are interested in using.
<br>
The app will then perform a search and return 5-8 soups/salads.

After researching and looking into APIs, we decided to use the ones below since they are both free and have straight forward instructions:

Weather API:
https://open-meteo.com/

Geographic location API:
https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/

Recipe API:
https://developer.edamam.com/

Target audience:
<br>
Millennials with decision fatigue, limited time and cooking skills. Looking for a fast and easy productive tool with minimal decisions required, to help them make food based on their location and dietary preferences.

<strong>Challenges</strong>
1. Coordination of tasks:
- Group members weren't clear on what to do, so the same task was carried out by 2 members at once.
- Group members had different backgrounds and hence some found tasks very challenging and took more time to meet a goal than others would have.

2. Familiarity with tools:
- After discussing different task-assignment and communication tools, team members would have to also spend time learning to use the chosen tools.
- Significant time was also spent on learning about how to use chosen APIs and reading their documentation.

3. Time:
- Each member would have to explain changes they made, reasoning for it, and how it was done to others which consumed a lot of time
- Members would be late to meeting due to external conditions which cut off contact time in class
- All team members would have to agree on decisions such as defult setup for pages, logo, task assignment, etc. which would result in less time being left to focus on more detailed tasks.
