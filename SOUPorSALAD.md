Project Title: SOUP or SALAD
contributers: Moral, Victoria, Crystal

Project Description:
Soup or Salad is a fun suggestion app providing a list of soup or salad recipes depending on weather conditions in the user's location. The user will be able to enter their location (which will be saved in the client-side and can be changed at any time), a dietary profile, and 1-2 ingredients they currently have or are interested in using; and the app will perform a search and return 5-8 soups/salads.

After researching and looking into 2 APIs, we decided to use the ones below sisnce they are both free and easy to use on their own:
Weather API:
https://open-meteo.com/

Geograohic location API:
https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/

Recipe API:
https://developer.edamam.com/

Target audience:
Millennials with decision fatigue, limited time and cooking skills. Looking for a fast and easy productive tool with minimal decisions required to help them make food based on their location and dietary preferences.


User story:
As a millennial working as a developer:
I WANT to get an application which decides what I should eat on a gives day based on the weather of the city I'm in. 
SO THAT I can easily decide what to eat without having to make too many decisions.
